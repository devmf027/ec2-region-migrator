# ec2-region-migrator
Project for automating the migration of EC2 instances between regions in AWS.

## Project Description

The "ec2-region-migrator" is a Python application that facilitates the migration of EC2 instances from one AWS region to another. It retrieves essential information about your EC2 instances, VPC, security groups, and other related data using the Boto3 library, and then generates Terraform configuration files to recreate the infrastructure in a different region. This project aims to simplify the process of migrating your EC2 resources between AWS regions while ensuring data integrity and configuration continuity.

### Features and Functionality

- Fetches critical EC2 instance information, VPC and subnet details, security group configurations, and tags.
- Converts retrieved data into variables for Terraform configuration.
- Generates Terraform files to recreate the infrastructure in a target AWS region.
- Maintains audit records in JSON format for EC2 instances, security groups, and VPCs.
